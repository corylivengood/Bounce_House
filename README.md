Using the ever-so-famous "Inertial Bounce" expression found at www.graymachine.com and described as a "community effort" originally envisioned by Dan Ebberts and changed over time. 

When run, it automatically adds the inertial bounce expression to your selected parameter(s) along with 3 sliders that control the amplitude, frequency, and decay of your bounce.

Lots of love and appreciation to Scott Heath (www.gscottheath.com) for assistance.

TO USE

Simply place the script in the 'Scripts' folder in your AE application directory (NOT the Script UI Panels folder).

Then go to 'File,' 'Scripts,' and choose 'Bounce House.'

A few things to note:

 - Crazy things can happen if your slider values get too high.

 - If you apply it to multiple properties at once, it will make multiple sliders that are iterated with a number after them. It may be a good idea to go through and rename them to match your property (amp_scale, freq_position, etc.) to make it easier to know what controls what. I'm working on making this automatic, but haven't figured it out yet.
